## A Compact Course on Mathematical Methods

### Content Overview

The notes at hand cover the following topics:

1. Vectors and Matrices
2. Functions of Several Variables
3. Integration
4. Differential Equations

The main prerequiste that is required for being able to work through the
text is familiarity with functions of a single variable and differentiation.
Chapter 2 is then the natural follow-up to that prerequisite.
Differentiation for functions of several variables and applications
such as finding minima or maxima are covered.
Chapter 3 introduces integration; first for functions of one variable and then
for functions of several variables.
That second part, multivariate integration, is rather brief and more of a
quick taster and introduction of concepts rather than a systematic treatment.
Chapter 4 then does the same for differential equations.
You could call these three chapters 'advanced calculus'.

The material in chapter 1, vectors and matrices, isn't usually taught together
with calculus -- it is covered here because it is the other important basic
mathematical methods topic needed in STEM
(with calculus being the first; actually, there is a third such topic:
probability and statistics, which is not covered, but I'd be open to starting
collaborations to add a compact chapter on it).
Chapter 1 isn't a prerequisite for the other chapters, but it makes some of
the multivariate notation prettier.

These notes are application-oriented and the philosophy is to
cover the basic concepts quickly, go through a good amount of examples and
exercises, and then move on. No need to go down rabbit holes.
That's where the 'compact' in the title comes from.
Despite focus on methods for applied computations and solving problems,
a few more theoretical remarks and exercises can be found in the text.
Elements of abstract mathematical rigour can be found as well -- I tried to
do give a taste of this way of thinking in a friendly way.


### Contributions

You'd be very welcome to contribute, e.g.:

- spot typos or mistakes in the computations :eyes:
- set figures (some of them are hand-drawn atm :worried:)
- Latex improvements (cf. the list of applications... :anguished:)
- add examples / exercises :running:
- fill in some of the applications that are currently missing :mortar_board:

The smaller contributions can be made by raising issues on GitHub.
For the bigger contributions, a pull request from a fork would be best.
(In that case, I'd recommend discussing things first via an issue.)
If people start getting involved, I'll add a credits section at the end, listing those who've helped out :+1:
