## Contributions

You'd be very welcome to contribute, e.g.:

- spot typos or mistakes in the computations :eyes:
- make suggestions on how to improve the exposition
- set figures (some of them are hand-drawn atm :worried:)
- Latex improvements (cf. the list of applications... :anguished:)
- add examples / exercises
- fill in some of the applications that are currently missing
- request topics to be added, or even write them yourself :mortar_board:

The smaller contributions can be made by raising issues on GitHub.
For the bigger contributions, a pull request from a fork would be best.
(In that case, I'd very much recommend discussing things first via an issue.)
I'll add a credits section at the end, listing those who've helped out :wink:

Cheers :grin: --PP
